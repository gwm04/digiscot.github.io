### Project description
We have a rich history of using technology to enrich our workshops, and the results are undeniable. Joyful, high quality creative work has been the backbone of the hundreds of lives we have changed for the better. Using technology is also a great risk, we have seen cyberbullying, dangerous behaviour online and inappropriate use of technology. Our staff are trained to respond to these events and we all know the vulnerabilities of the people we work with. Building in a robust layer of IT skill and good sense across all our workshops will take a lot of work and a ‘learning by stealth’ approach. 

For example our photography workshop have created an amazing collection of themed albums, but we do not currently have the capacity to connect or share their work on the internet. This is something that can bring critical attention, the thrill, joy and risk of choosing, displaying, publishing and sharing your work with others is something that we desperately want our students to experience. This grant will help us do that in a safe, structured way. 

The project will be a collaboration between our Education and Curriculum Manager and our workshop facilitators. They will work together to implement the digital skills appropriate to our students in ways that enhance the following workshops throughout the grant period: 

* Photography workshop every Monday (8 Students) 
* Social Media awareness every Thursday (5 Students) 
* Cafe project every Monday/Tuesday (8 Students) 
* Prestonpans Multi Media Workshops every Monday ( 9 Students) 

We will use a mixed environment of technology; tablets, PCs and laptops, office and free software, just as in the real world. We have a donated suite of 10 desktop PC’s all windows, thanks to the TT-Exchange program we have licensed versions of Windows 7. We use free or online version of software including Google Picasa, to manage the photography workshops. This grant will allow us to buy enough tablets so we can have two and sometimes three workshops using them at once.

Another example where we will implement a digital skills layer of learning using this grant is our new cafe project. Funded by Community Food & Health Scotland and the Clothworkers Foundation as well as other smaller funders. It is a small social enterprise that will start out providing healthy lunches cooked by and consumed by our students. We will run the cafe as an enterprise and involve the students in the business, promotion, and research for the cafe. This will be done in a structured way using skills and materials provided by this grant. 

We also have a similar ‘framework’ approach to equipping our students with skills that will help them approach sustainable employment and digital life skills together. This grant will feed into that work, and our application to the RBS Skills and Opportunities fund to add more digital skills and training to our employability themed workshops, including a special strand in the Cafe Project.


### Planned project milestones

* First purchases and staff training starts at the start of December. Staff will receive training from Quarriers based upon their proven Go For It sessions. We will start planning the first workshops; Photography and Social Media workshops first. First purchases include 8 android tablets a secure housing and charging station and 3 wireless hubs: April 2016 - Complete

* Staff complete lesson plans for all 4 workshops (Photography + Social Media + Cafe project + Preston pans Multi media). By the end of December: staff will also have completed the soft rollout of the program. After reviewing initial evaluation they will have lesson plans developed for the first block of all four workshops. This milestone includes incremental costs for staff time. Both facilitator and Education and curriculum Manager. A baseline version of the Digital Skills test will be taken: May 2016 - Complete

* Internal analysis and evaluation, corrective steps if necessary. The first 12 week block of workshops will be completed for all four workshops. The first evaluation will be in and we will have a good idea of what is working well and what needs more work. Facilitator evaluation will be ongoing, but will be formally recorded here: August 2016 - Complete
*

* Half way evaluation of students and project. The project half way point. The second block of workshops will be evaluated and the program tweaked. If appropriate we will do another modified Digital Skills baseline test. We should have some good outputs by our new, digitally proficient students: August 2016
* 




* Final evaluation and a plan for continuation. The final evaluation is delivered for the last block. We will have a body of knowledge about how to implement digital skills for all our students across all our workshops. We will build on our successes, report our challenges and be equipped for years to come: October 2016 

### Progress Report May 2016

**Target - First purchases and staff training starts.**  Complete

* Staff will receive training from Ouarriers. Based upon their Go For It sessions. **Booked provisionally for 17th May.  Staff identified and freed up.** - Complet

* We will start planning the first workshops. **Already done – introductory sessions with each planned and booked for 23rd May** 

* Launching with the Photography and Social Media workshops first. First purchases include 8 android tablets a secure housing and charging station and 3 wireless hubs.  **All purchased and all arrived except the charging station.** - Now Complete


**Progress this month.** 

*1. Purchasing* 

All purchasing has been completed.  8 iPads have been purchased, with covers and screens for each.  The Boardmaker software has been bought and tried, the disk is able to install on Windows only, so this has been factored into the planning.  The secure housing and charging station has been purchased and a space has been cleared for storage for it.  The wireless hubs have been purchased and plugged in to check their use. 

*2. Workshops* 

Facilitators have been identified, and discussion of the trial has taken place with them.  The initial plans have been completed with all so everyone has a starting point.  This has use of iPad built into it, for the students and the staff.  IPad set up time has been set up for 2/5/16 with the assistance of 3 of the facilitators (1 cannot attend).  All staff had refresher training booked on Apple software currently in use as a refresher in advance. 

*3. Training* 

Training provisionally booked for 17th May, all staff attending aware, waiting on final word from Quarriers.  Introductory session discussion will take place at the end of this day.  At this point we will have a soft roll out of all workshops (with same material at first week, then planning to be completed for remaining 3 weeks by 21st May. 

**Next steps** 

Staff complete lesson plans and first block of training 21st May 2016 Done

First workshops with integrated IT outcomes start 23rd May 2016 Done

Baseline survey for Basic Digital Skills completed 27th May 2016 Done

First 12 week block completed – First evaluation 5th August 2016 
* Photography workshop every Monday (8 Students) 
We have used the iPads as cameras, a lot of our students find the digital camera too fiddly to use, not so much in buttons but in how small the screen is.  When we have the big screens of the iPad it allows more preplanning of what shots are taken, we take less shots, but have more discussion surrounding what shots we do take.  In terms of what we do after.  We can edit the shots more easily using the iPhoto software.  This means we can actually either edit when we return or even edit in the minibus on the way back, we can have lots more opportunities to see each picture, and we have also brought in editing as a group using the projector.  This has set up new oppurtunities to open out the workshop.

* Social Media awareness every Thursday (5 Students) 
We are looking into social media sites, our computers are so old that we could not really use these for this task.  We have been using these to look at each social network but what has been even better is how the workshop has been able to link in with other students.  We can use the iPad with the projector to do live info and training on social media with the social media on screen as an example.  We can do live updates and it’s so much more reliable.
* Cafe project every Monday/Tuesday (8 Students) 
The café is in a transitional phase right now.  We are currently open 2 days and hope to be open 3 soon.  Currently the iPads are used before and after the cooking and selling.  We hope to use it during cooking too very soon, taking it to the next level.  At the end of the day, we use the iPads to order the materials.  We have found a money planning App which we use to set the budget for the next week, at first the students were surprised at how much things cost, but are starting to get used to this style and getting faster with it.  Another advantage of using the iPads, is that we can check supplies in real time, wandering around to see what we need.  Prior to making it, we use the Visual Recipes app to plan out what we are doing that day.  This is accessible to all in the workshop, as opposed to written instructions.  Our next plan is to link the iPad to a Bluetooth till so students can take orders in a visual way using the following app

* Prestonpans Multi Media Workshops every Monday ( 9 Students)
Multimedia has been able to expand into a more cohesive film making experience.  The iPad acts as an all in one solution for getting the workshop to function.  In pre-production we use the Story app, to plan the shots.  This allows students to be in the moment with the experience, and it quickens it a lot as it allows generic drawings to be used for shots.  This means pre-production can be a 2 person job, and allows set creation and outfits at the same time.  Means that a film can be turned round much quicker.  During filming, we use the iPad as a camera, the students find it much easier as this is much larger and clearer than a regular camera screen.  This means we can have an additional stage when filming where we can plan the lighting and image, this means we can have people act more as the roles within filming, making it more worthwhile and work experience led.  We have made the buttons bigger and more accessible with the iPads accessibility section, the next stage for us is to find a way to mount to the camera.  We use iMovie to edit this (this comes free with the iPad), which the students are now familiar with.  We do this in a visual way using the smart board so that everyone can contribute to this.  Very visual and lets everyone take part to varying degrees.  I think the process itself is a lot quicker and more student friendly as a result. Most of the students are very tech savvy anyway, so the iPads are really good as an engagement tool, it’s made a huge difference.


### Planned outputs and outcomes

* People with disabilities will be safer and less vulnerable when using online tools

* People with disabilities will have a bigger voice in the digital conversation 

* People with disabilities will have higher self esteem because they can do more for themselves
