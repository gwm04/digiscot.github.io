### Project description
We have a rich history of using technology to enrich our workshops, and the results are undeniable. Joyful, high quality creative work has been the backbone of the hundreds of lives we have changed for the better. Using technology is also a great risk, we have seen cyberbullying, dangerous behaviour online and inappropriate use of technology. Our staff are trained to respond to these events and we all know the vulnerabilities of the people we work with. Building in a robust layer of IT skill and good sense across all our workshops will take a lot of work and a ‘learning by stealth’ approach.

For example our photography workshop have created an amazing collection of themed albums, but we do not currently have the capacity to connect or share their work on the internet. This is something that can bring critical attention, the thrill, joy and risk of choosing, displaying, publishing and sharing your work with others is something that we desperately want our students to experience. This grant will help us do that in a safe, structured way.

The project will be a collaboration between our Education and Curriculum Manager and our workshop facilitators. They will work together to implement the digital skills appropriate to our students in ways that enhance the following workshops throughout the grant period:

* Photography workshop every Monday (8 Students)
* Social Media awareness every Thursday (5 Students)
* Cafe project every Monday/Tuesday (8 Students)
* Prestonpans Multi Media Workshops every Monday ( 9 Students)

We will use a mixed environment of technology; tablets, PCs and laptops, office and free software, just as in the real world. We have a donated suite of 10 desktop PC’s all windows, thanks to the TT-Exchange program we have licensed versions of Windows 7. We use free or online version of software including Google Picasa, to manage the photography workshops. This grant will allow us to buy enough tablets so we can have two and sometimes three workshops using them at once.

Another example where we will implement a digital skills layer of learning using this grant is our new cafe project. Funded by Community Food & Health Scotland and the Clothworkers Foundation as well as other smaller funders. It is a small social enterprise that will start out providing healthy lunches cooked by and consumed by our students. We will run the cafe as an enterprise and involve the students in the business, promotion, and research for the cafe. This will be done in a structured way using skills and materials provided by this grant.

We also have a similar ‘framework’ approach to equipping our students with skills that will help them approach sustainable employment and digital life skills together. This grant will feed into that work, and our application to the RBS Skills and Opportunities fund to add more digital skills and training to our employability themed workshops, including a special strand in the Cafe Project.


### Planned project milestones

* First purchases and staff training starts at the start of December. Staff will receive training from Quarriers based upon their proven Go For It sessions. We will start planning the first workshops; Photography and Social Media workshops first. First purchases include 8 android tablets a secure housing and charging station and 3 wireless hubs: April 2016

* Staff complete lesson plans for all 4 workshops (Photography + Social Media + Cafe project + Preston pans Multi media). By the end of December: staff will also have completed the soft rollout of the program. After reviewing initial evaluation they will have lesson plans developed for the first block of all four workshops. This milestone includes incremental costs for staff time. Both facilitator and Education and curriculum Manager. A baseline version of the Digital Skills test will be taken: May 2016

* Internal analysis and evaluation, corrective steps if necessary. The first 12 week block of workshops will be completed for all four workshops. The first evaluation will be in and we will have a good idea of what is working well and what needs more work. Facilitator evaluation will be ongoing, but will be formally recorded here: August 2016

* Half way evaluation of students and project. The project half way point. The second block of workshops will be evaluated and the program tweaked. If appropriate we will do another modified Digital Skills baseline test. We should have some good outputs by our new, digitally proficient students: August 2016

* Final evaluation and a plan for continuation. The final evaluation is delivered for the last block. We will have a body of knowledge about how to implement digital skills for all our students across all our workshops. We will build on our successes, report our challenges and be equipped for years to come: October 2016

### Progress Report May 2016

**Target - First purchases and staff training starts.**

* Staff will receive training from Ouarriers. Based upon their Go For It sessions. **Booked provisionally for 17th May.  Staff identified and freed up.**

* We will start planning the first workshops. **Already done – introductory sessions with each planned and booked for 23rd May**

* Launching with the Photography and Social Media workshops first. First purchases include 8 android tablets a secure housing and charging station and 3 wireless hubs.  **All purchased and all arrived except the charging station.**


**Progress this month.**

*1. Purchasing*

All purchasing has been completed.  8 iPads have been purchased, with covers and screens for each.  The Boardmaker software has been bought and tried, the disk is able to install on Windows only, so this has been factored into the planning.  The secure housing and charging station has been purchased and a space has been cleared for storage for it.  The wireless hubs have been purchased and plugged in to check their use.

*2. Workshops*

Facilitators have been identified, and discussion of the trial has taken place with them.  The initial plans have been completed with all so everyone has a starting point.  This has use of iPad built into it, for the students and the staff.  IPad set up time has been set up for 2/5/16 with the assistance of 3 of the facilitators (1 cannot attend).  All staff had refresher training booked on Apple software currently in use as a refresher in advance.

*3. Training*

Training provisionally booked for 17th May, all staff attending aware, waiting on final word from Quarriers.  Introductory session discussion will take place at the end of this day.  At this point we will have a soft roll out of all workshops (with same material at first week, then planning to be completed for remaining 3 weeks by 21st May.

**Next steps**

Staff complete lesson plans and first block of training 21st May 2016

First workshops with integrated IT outcomes start 23rd May 2016

Baseline survey for Basic Digital Skills completed 27th May 2016

First 12 week block completed – First evaluation 5th August 2016


### Planned outputs and outcomes

* People with disabilities will be safer and less vulnerable when using online tools

* People with disabilities will have a bigger voice in the digital conversation

* People with disabilities will have higher self esteem because they can do more for themselves



### Evaluation

* Photography workshop every Monday (8 Students) 
We have used the iPads as cameras, a lot of our students find the digital camera too fiddly to use, not so much in buttons but in how small the screen is.  When we have the big screens of the iPad it allows more preplanning of what shots are taken, we take less shots, but have more discussion surrounding what shots we do take.  In terms of what we do after.  We can edit the shots more easily using the iPhoto software.  This means we can actually either edit when we return or even edit in the minibus on the way back, we can have lots more opportunities to see each picture, and we have also brought in editing as a group using the projector.  This has set up new oppurtunities to open out the workshop.

* Social Media awareness every Thursday (5 Students) 
We are looking into social media sites, our computers are so old that we could not really use these for this task.  We have been using these to look at each social network but what has been even better is how the workshop has been able to link in with other students.  We can use the iPad with the projector to do live info and training on social media with the social media on screen as an example.  We can do live updates and it’s so much more reliable.
* Cafe project every Monday/Tuesday (8 Students) 
The café is in a transitional phase right now.  We are currently open 2 days and hope to be open 3 soon.  Currently the iPads are used before and after the cooking and selling.  We hope to use it during cooking too very soon, taking it to the next level.  At the end of the day, we use the iPads to order the materials.  We have found a money planning App which we use to set the budget for the next week, at first the students were surprised at how much things cost, but are starting to get used to this style and getting faster with it.  Another advantage of using the iPads, is that we can check supplies in real time, wandering around to see what we need.  Prior to making it, we use the Visual Recipes app to plan out what we are doing that day.  This is accessible to all in the workshop, as opposed to written instructions.  Our next plan is to link the iPad to a Bluetooth till so students can take orders in a visual way using the following app

* Prestonpans Multi Media Workshops every Monday ( 9 Students)
Multimedia has been able to expand into a more cohesive film making experience.  The iPad acts as an all in one solution for getting the workshop to function.  In pre-production we use the Story app, to plan the shots.  This allows students to be in the moment with the experience, and it quickens it a lot as it allows generic drawings to be used for shots.  This means pre-production can be a 2 person job, and allows set creation and outfits at the same time.  Means that a film can be turned round much quicker.  During filming, we use the iPad as a camera, the students find it much easier as this is much larger and clearer than a regular camera screen.  This means we can have an additional stage when filming where we can plan the lighting and image, this means we can have people act more as the roles within filming, making it more worthwhile and work experience led.  We have made the buttons bigger and more accessible with the iPads accessibility section, the next stage for us is to find a way to mount to the camera.  We use iMovie to edit this (this comes free with the iPad), which the students are now familiar with.  We do this in a visual way using the smart board so that everyone can contribute to this.  Very visual and lets everyone take part to varying degrees.  I think the process itself is a lot quicker and more student friendly as a result. Most of the students are very tech savvy anyway, so the iPads are really good as an engagement tool, it’s made a huge difference.

Outcomes
1.	People with disabilities will be safer when using online tools – SCVO + RBS
a.	Increasing the training of our staff and increasing the impact of teaching through real world examples will have a bigger impact than classroom type learning on our students. This will increase the chance of our students gaining life skills that will increase their safety in every area the use online tools and services. This will reduce their vulnerability to deception and predatory online practices. 

Outcome Feedback:  
We agreed that we would look into people with disabilities will be safer when using online tools.  There was a few different ways we looked into this.  The first thing we looked at was training for the staff members.  We looked at iPad training which had two sides to it.  The first thing we wanted to look at was how to make the iPads accessible to all.  We went over all the accessibility options, paying particular attention to the students we had identified to take part.  The trainees involved were a mix of facilitators and trainers who could assist in cascading this training to others.  The second part was looking at accessible apps and how we could make these seem more real to the students.  Choosing apps that related to real world situations like painting and identifying money being two examples that students requested as Apps that would be relevant to them in our initial information gathering.  Once we had this training in place, we had an initial period of iPad set up using the relevant facilitators (to keep the information fresh in their mind) and a group of student reps who were to assist in putting together all the apps in a student friendly fashion.  Once they were installed we ran pilot projects with four different workshops (Digital Photography, social Media, Multimedia and Café project.)  We decided to focus on the Social Media and Multimedia in the main instance on looking towards gaining life skills when working online.  The social media workshop worked on a project that was all about social media safety, and how to transfer this information onto other students, a multimedia style was used with info on social media, information on posters and specific presentations for other students using interactive methods with the iPads.  The multimedia group took a different tact.  They designed a unit using the iPads with the workshop designing it in real time over a 12 week unit, deciding on what to include with student assistance.  This can now be used with other workshops if they book out the iPads.

2.	People with disabilities will have a bigger voice in the digital conversation – RBS + SCVO
a.	The digital divide will be reduced when everyone is consuming and producing digital content on a level playing field. The benefits of sharing and connecting through online platforms will be open to more people through our real world examples and by applying these principles to more workshops after the life of this grant.
Outcome Feedback:  
Digital Photography has always been a great producer of content, with no real plan as to where it is shared too.  The grant has assisted us to have more of a clear plan with the digital photography output and more of a plan to change the way students have access to their own products and how they may share them.  The digital photography group has traditionally been a very set group who would decide on a place, visit the place, return to Upward Mobility and then edit the pictures the pictures would just stay on the computer until it was time for them to be deleted.  The iPads have given us a lot more flexibility with this group.  One of the main issues before the iPads was how limiting the current cameras we had were to the students from an accessibility perspective.  The buttons were tiny, as was the display screen which did not suit many students and it was hard for them to task focus.  To counteract this we have been able to use the iPads as cameras, providing students with a bigger button and screen to see with.  This has been a great success with them and makes thing a lot easier when it comes to planning shots.  We can be choosier with what we take and take time over it with the facilitator being able to wander and have real time interaction with shot selection.  This has also opened up the reviewing process too, we can review shots in more detail at the point of creation where we can review where info is fresh in the student’s minds.  It just makes the process all the more immediate and more relevant to the consumption culture that students live in.   This also allows them to edit more in real time too, which is more what students relate to as the process is still very fresh.  The ease of the iPads has also ensured we can pass on the pictures for social media use.  This has set up new opportunities to open out the workshop.

3.	People with disabilities will have higher self-esteem  - RBS + SCVO
a.	Seeing public and peer recognition of one’s creative and enterprising efforts will increase the self-esteem of our students as productive members of society. 
b.	JOBS – Moving closer to the employment market and receiving recognition for that work will increase the satisfaction with our students’ time at UPMO, and of this part of their lives.
Outcome Feedback:  

The main purpose of our café project has been to work on self-esteem and work experience.  The café itself has been set up as a social enterprise to create revenue to keep itself working and ticking over.  The students are pushed harder than in any other workshop as they have strict deadlines to meet each day with customers arriving in two different slots for lunch of various different types like baked potatoes, chilli con carne, toasties and scones.  To enable the students to work in the café, they have to have a specific training to be put in place.  The iPad assigned to cooking helped the training to run in a fun and accessible way using the accessibility options of the iPad to assist all students in being able to read the information effectively.  This also assists the group with ordering the supplies at the end of the day.  Rather than create the lists for the shopping manually it also meant that we could shop in real time walking around seeing what we are missing and interacting with the students to see what recipes they wanted to see on sale.  This has been a great success and has allowed us to see the development in the seven students who have been working in the café, seeing how their confidence and self-respect has grown.  Their feedback to other students has enabled a new extra day to be set up with one of the students acting as student volunteer leader, assisting the other students as a peer giving instructions.  In the future we have been trialling till software and hope to seek funding to get this in place so it can be used in all 3 days.  IT will mean we can use the iPads and have students to act as serving staff, who can place orders directly to the till from a visual menu on the iPad.

Direct Student Assistance
This is the amount of students who attended the trail on most of the weeks to gather the feedback required
Cafe project every Monday/Tuesday (8 Students)
Indirect Student Assistance
60% of students use the café each day it is open,  This is more students with access to healthy eating choices and time to interact with their peers.  The fact they can see their peers at work is a uncountable goal of this too.
